Tic‑Tac‑Toe Web Application: 3rd task of my web development internship at Prodigy Infotech.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It implements core functionalities such as handling user clicks, tracking the game state, and checking for winning conditions. The application provides an interactive and engaging experience where users can play against each other, aiming to align three markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.

✨ Features:

● Interactive Board – Click‑based interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

● Win/Draw Detection – Automatically checks for a winner or draw after every move.

● Turn Indicator – Shows whose turn it is.

● Responsive Layout – Clean and simple UI that works on different screen sizes.

● Restart Game – One‑click reset to start a new match anytime.

● Lightweight & Fast – Pure front‑end implementation with no external libraries needed.
